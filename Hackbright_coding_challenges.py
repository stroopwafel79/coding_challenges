#############Is the word an anagram of a palindrome?
# A palindrome is a word that reads the same forward and backwards 
# (eg, “racecar”, “tacocat”). An anagram is a rescrambling of a word (eg for “racecar”, you could rescramble this as “arceace”).
# Determine if the given word is a re-scrambling of a palindrome.
# The word will only contain lowercase letters, a-z.

#########Decode a string

# In this challenge, you’ll write a decoder.

# A valid code is a sequence of numbers and letters, always starting with a number 
# and ending with letter(s).

# Each number tells you how many characters to skip before finding a good letter. 
#After each good letter should come the next next number.

# For example, the string “hey” could be encoded by “0h1ae2bcy”. This means “skip 0, 
#find the ‘h’, skip 1, find the ‘e’, skip 2, find the ‘y’”.

# A single letter should work:
